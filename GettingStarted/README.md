TypeScript is an programming language and as well the tool which is required to compile the typescript programming language to the javascript language.

To compile the typescript file into the javascript file we must type the following command -

We must tell the typescript that every variable is of what datatype.

We must always import javascript file not the .ts file in the index.html file.

-> It also proivides meta programming features like decorators.
